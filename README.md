# Student-Performance-Prediction

# 📊 Student Progress Dashboard

A Streamlit-based interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize student performance data, aimed at helping educators, institutions, or academic stakeholders monitor academic progress.


# ✅ Project Highlights

- 🔍 "Data Exploration" of student academic records using Pandas and Streamlit.
- 📈 "Visualized student performance" across various parameters like:
  - Subject-wise marks
  - Attendance
  - Internal assessment performance
- 🎯 Identified at-risk students based on grades or performance drop.
- 🧠 Incorporated insights to support **data-driven academic decisions**.
- 🛠️ Built using Python, Streamlit, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- 📁 Powered by a custom `.csv` dataset (`student_performance_data.csv`).


# 🧰 Tech Stack

- "Python"
- "Pandas", "NumPy" for data handling
- "Streamlit" for frontend dashboard
- "Matplotlib"/"Seaborn" for data visualization

# 📊 Sample Dashboard Output

* Student-wise grade trends
* Filters for semester/section
* Alert indicators for poor performance
* Downloadable reports (optional add-on)


# ✨ Future Enhancements

* Add "login system" for teachers/students.
* Integrate with "real-time databases" like Firebase.
